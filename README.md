2048FX
======

This is another version of the game 2048, this time built using JavaFX, JavaFXPorts mobile [plugin](https://bitbucket.org/javafxports/javafxmobile-plugin) and Gluon [Charm Down](https://bitbucket.org/gluon-oss/charm-down) to run on Desktop, Android and iOS platforms with the very same codebase.

The game is based on a fork of the fully Java 8 [version](https://github.com/brunoborges/fx2048)
by Bruno [Borges](bruno.borges@oracle.com( & José [Pereda](jperedadnr@gmail.com), which was also based on a 
fork based on the original Javascript [version](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) by Gabriele Cirulli.

 - Android and Desktop (Java 7 adaptation): José Pereda
 - iOS version: Jens [Deters](mail@jensd.de)
